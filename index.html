SPYOSCAPE is a (work in progress) hobby project that aiming to localise and map the artwork of the Danish graffiti artist SPYO. The artwork included on this site contains only political statements, phrases or alike. This means that regular tags and throwups etc. are not mapped.

Am I missing something?
You are very welcome to mail me at spyoscape@nordskov.net with images of artwork I have not yet mapped, preferrably with GPS location included in the EXIF data. Please keep a sane aspect ratio :) If you are familiar with Git, feel free to submit a pull request with your additions. The code is available at https://github.com/ztychr/spyoscape. Thank you for stopping by!
